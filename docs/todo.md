# Major Tasks #

This document outlines the major tasks to be completed.
Think of this as a "large feature backlog".

- Kernel memory management (page_alloc, page_free, malloc, free)
- Switch to another process (transfer control)
- User space process (Different page table)
- New build system (Buck? Make? Bazel?)
